### 98-008: Intro to the Rust Programming Language



# Iter Lab

The goal of this homework is to make sure you are comfortable with Rust's Iterators and Closures.

This homework is more puzzle-oriented than the last few homeworks, where instead of implementing
one relatively complicated thing, you will implement 6 somewhat-less-complicated things.

Since we're halfway through the semester, we will be providing less guidance in this writeup.
Remember, you just need to make the tests pass!

Since you know how to read tests now, we encourage you to read some of the tests
_before_ you start writing any code.

All tests are located in `src/tests.rs`.

# Submission


### Unix

If you are on a unix system, we will try to create a `handin.zip` automatically for you,
**but you will need to have `zip` already installed**.

If you _do not_ have `zip` installed on your system,
install `zip` on your machine or use the CMU Linux SSH machines.
If you need help with this, please reach out to us!

Once you have `zip` installed, we will create the `handin.zip` automatically for you
(_take a peek into `build.rs` if you're interested in how this works!_).

Once you have the `handin.zip` file, submit it to Gradescope.


### Windows

If you are on a windows system, you can zip the `src/` folder manually
and upload that to Gradescope.

Note that you don't _need_ to name it `handin.zip`, you can name it whatever you'd like.



# Collaboration

In general, feel free to discuss homeworks with other students!
As long as you do not copy someone else's work, any communication is fair game.

All formal questions should be asked on Piazza. Try to discuss on Piazza so that
other students can see your questions and answers as well!

You can also discuss on Discord, but try to keep any technical questions on Piazza.



# Feedback

We would like to reiterate that you should let us know if you spent
anywhere in significant excess of an hour on this homework.

In addition, Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve,
so if you find yourself not understanding the concepts,
you should reach out to us and let us know as well ---
chances are, you're not the only one!
